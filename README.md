![The Site Map](/ux-design/SiteMap.png)


### When the user boots up the app, this will be the first screen that is presented.
Note: as per design advice, the "Explore" button does not prompt any login - rather - it simply serves as the landing page for the application. Once a user clicks on the "Explore" button, they will be brough to the rest of the application.
